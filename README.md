# Online-shop

Shopaholic is an online shopping application that is developed using dart and flutter on visual 
studio code. It allows you to make an account, scroll through tons of clothes in many categories to 
buy whatever you like by just clicking the add to cart button and even add clothes to the 
application to put them for sale. 

The database for this application is made using Firebase Authentication for userâ€™s accounts and 
Firebase Cloud Firestore for storing the products that are available for sale and their details.
